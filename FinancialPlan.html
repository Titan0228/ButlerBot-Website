<h2> <ul> 

	<li> Our robot has a total cost of $100,000. The hardware costs a total of $90,000 because we use ultra lightweight yet strong titanium for our robot. Our software cost 100,000$. </li> <br>
	<li> We moved our office space from USA to India because the office space there is way cheaper than in the USA, also we hire local skilled workers from India and we pay them a good amount of money to encourage workers to work here and attract more workers to work for our company. Because of the high salery we pay to them, they will become the top 1% of the entire India. </li>
